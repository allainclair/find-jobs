Our users come to Pinterest to explore ideas and run more than 6 billion search queries every month. Many of these queries represent exploratory search intent and are broad, which means that the search system should be able to deeply understand this intent, and then help people explore content, personalize results, harness visual signals effectively, and show the most engaging content up front. In addition, the team also owns query refinements and modules that help Pinners narrow their search intent from broad exploratory queries, to help them narrow their results down. All of this means that Pinterest search presents a unique challenge quite unlike other search systems and the opportunity to innovate on a product that only Pinterest can build. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are looking for an exceptional senior engineering manager to help lead the search machine learning teams.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>What you will do:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candidate will be responsible for major areas of the search engine for more than 450 million monthly active Pinterest users, including indexing and document ranking, query and content understanding, personalization, ML based retrieval, shopping, videos, as well as infrastructure efficiency and scalability.
